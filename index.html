      <div class="hello">Hi, I'm Chien, my friends call me Jeff.</div>
      <div class="intro">
        I'm an aspiring Web Developer with a interest in all things computers. I
        have a BA in Business Administration and spent most of my career working
        in IT. Recently, I decided to make a leap into tech. I gained valuable
        experience during my Georgia Tech bootcamp honing my skills in HTML,
        CSS, Javascript, MySQL, MongoDB, and other various frameworks. I look
        forward to bringing my skills to a company where I can build
        applications and assist everyday people.
